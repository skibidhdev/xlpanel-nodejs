# XLPanel Node.js

## Project Overview
**XLPanel Node.js** is a Node.js rewrite of the Xlpanel backend and theme, designed for managing game servers efficiently. It provides a modern approach to server management with a robust backend, leveraging popular frameworks and modules.

## Installation
To run the project, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to install the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/xlpanel-node.git
    cd xlpanel-node
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Setup environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any necessary configuration variables (refer to the original configuration format in `config.json` for guidance).

## Usage
You can start the project using the following command:

- **For production**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- **For development (with auto-reload)**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Once the server is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (replace with the configured port if changed).

## Features
- **Game server management**: Manage multiple game servers from a single interface.
- **Real-time communication**: Utilize socket.io for live updates and notifications.
- **Robust session management**: Enabled with Express sessions to retain user sessions securely.
- **Templating engine support**: Leverage EJS for dynamic content rendering.
- **Database support**: Currently supports SQLite for storing server and user data.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following key dependencies (as found in `package.json`):

- `axios`: For making HTTP requests.
- `cookie-parser`: For parsing cookies.
- `dotenv`: To manage environment variables.
- `ejs`: For templating.
- `express`: Web framework for building web applications.
- `express-ejs-layouts`: EJS layout support for Express.
- `express-session`: Middleware for session management.
- `helmet`: For securing HTTP headers.
- `morgan`: For logging HTTP requests.
- `sqlite3`: SQLite database support.
- `socket.io`: For real-time web socket communication.
- `bcrypt`: For password hashing and security.
- `connect-sqlite3`: SQLite session store for Express.
